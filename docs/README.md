# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

## Overview

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management process documentation. This README serves as your central entry point and navigation resource for all project management processes used by OctoAcme.

OctoAcme follows a staged, pragmatic project management approach designed to deliver value efficiently while managing risk and maintaining clear communication. Our processes span the entire project lifecycle:

- **Initiation**: Starting projects with clear objectives and stakeholder alignment
- **Planning**: Defining scope, timelines, resources, and deliverables
- **Execution & Tracking**: Managing day-to-day work and progress monitoring
- **Risk Management & Communication**: Identifying risks early and maintaining stakeholder engagement
- **Release & Deployment**: Ensuring smooth transitions to production
- **Retrospectives**: Learning from each project cycle to drive continuous improvement
- **Roles & Personas**: Defining team structures and responsibilities
